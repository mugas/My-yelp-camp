# My-yelp-camp
Yelp Camp tutorial from [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
Created in <em>node.js</em> and using <em>Express</em>as framework. Use <em>bootstrap 3</em> for markup and styling
As database use <em>Mongodb</em>.

This was my first aproach to the backend. Like in the [Colorfull game](https://github.com/mugas/colorfullgame)
with this tutorial I also decided that I had to create my own [version](https://github.com/mugas/good_stuff_foods) because
the amount of skills and new subjects I learn from front-end and back-end in this tutorial was usefull to get more confident 
with JS but also with new frameworks and tools.
